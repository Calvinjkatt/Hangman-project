**Project Title:**

&emsp;Hangman (Vehicle Edition)


**Project Description:**

&emsp;Users will have to guess the correct words in increasing difficulty. Game does not end until the user runs out of tries. For example, if the user guesses one word, but loses a few lives, then they go to the next round with the same number of lives left.. (Alternatively, you can restore a life word every 3 words guessed successfully). Users will be able to track their remaining lives by viewing the vehicle depicted on the screen. Users will be able to track their highest scores via the leaderboard option.
